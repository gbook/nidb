<description><![CDATA[xTableHeaderFixed is an unobtrusive table enhancement. It makes a copy of a table's THEAD section. While the table is visible in its container the THEAD copy will be fixed to the top of the container, so you can scroll up and down in a long table and the header will always be visible. The container can be a window or a scrollable element. The position and size of the THEAD copy will be adjusted when the window is resized. The THEAD copy is clipped to its container's inner width. You only need to instantiate one xTableHeaderFixed object for each group of tables that have the same styling - and so those tables should have a common className, which you pass to the constructor. You must assign all of the table's styles relative to this className so that the THEAD copy will be styled just like it. It takes the widths of all THs (not TDs) in the THEAD and assigns them to the corresponding THs in the THEAD copy. When instantiating, you do not have to keep a reference to the object - it keeps a reference to itself, but if you plan on calling the 'init' or 'paint' methods later then you'll need to keep a reference to the object.]]></description>

<comment><date>08Nov10</date><author>mf</author><note><![CDATA[Tips: 1. So far, the best results across browsers are with using the "separate borders with no cellspacing" technique as opposed to the "collapsed borders" technique. 2. When the header is wide, it is clipped properly but it may cause a horizontal scrollbar on the window. A work-around is to use "body{overflow-x:hidden;}", altho it's not supported in IE7. 3. Using captions is supported but sometimes problematic.]]></note></comment>

Remove isWin argument.
Clip the header to the table's container.
If yOfs===0 do not hide the header.
Use column-width code ideas from theseeker. Remove use of xWidth.
Use code ideas from chris.fewtrell. No longer need CSS classes xthf-fix-tbl and xthf-abs-tbl, implemented in JS. The "hide" position changed from -2000 to -10000.
