# Calendar

### Calendar View

If the calendar is enabled in your NiDB installation, a link on the top menu will be available. The default view is the current week. Click Day, Week, or Month to change view. Click arrows to go forward or backward in the calendar. Click the dropdown list of calendars to change the current calendar. Information about what you are viewing will be displayed at the top of each page.

### Managing the Calendars

If you are an admin, you can click the **Manage** link on the second row of the menu. This will show a list of calendars. Click the **Add Calendar** button to create a new calendar. Click the calendar name to edit the calendar.

### Creating Appointments

On the Day, Week, or Month views, click the `+` button to add an appointment. Fill out the information, and click **Add**. Appointments can regular, or can be an **all day event** or **time request**, the latter special types do not block overlapping appointments from being created. For example, if a regular appointment is scheduled from 2:00pm-3:00pm, another appointment could not be scheduled from 2:30-3:30pm. But both appointments can be created if either one is a time request or all day event.

#### Issues

If you try to create an appointment and it says it conflicts with an existing appointment, but you can't see the offending appointment on the calendar, check if there is an appointment that spans more than one day. For example, if an appointment runs from 3pm Monday to 3pm Wednesday, you will not be able to create any appointments on Tuesday. This can be fixed by setting the multi-day appointment to be **all day**.

### Modifying Appointments

Click on the appointment to show appointment form. Make any changes and click **Update**. You can also modify a repeating appointment, or delete appointment.
