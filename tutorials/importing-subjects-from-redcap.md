# Importing Subjects from Redcap

### Steps

* For a project, subjects can be imported from redcap using an option on the project page as shown below:
* Fill the following form requiring information for API connection to redcap and required redcap field names. After providing the required fields click "Subjects Information" button.

If all the above information is correct, then the list of the subjects from redcap will be shown as follows:

There can be four types of subjects in the list. Those are:

1. Ready to Import: are the one those are in redcap and can be imported.
2. Found in an other project: these are present in another project under inthe NiDB database. They can also be imported, but need to be selected to get import.
3. Processing: these are already in the process of being imported and cannot be selected to import.
4. Already exist in the project: these already exist in the current project and cannot be duplicated.

After selecting the required subjects to import, click "Import Selected Subjects" to start the import process.

### Enroll in Project

In the enrollments section, select the project you want to enroll in, and click Enroll. The subject will now be enrolled in the project. Permissions within NiDB are determined by the project, which is in theory associated with an IRB approved protocol. If a subject is not enrolled in a project, the default is to have no permissions to view or edit the subject. Now that the subject is part of a project, you will have permissions to edit the subject's details. Once enrolled, you can edit the enrollment details and create studies.
