# Reports based on data imported from Redcap

Data that we imported from a Redcap project into a NiDB project can be used to create reports. These reports can be generated totally based on Redcap data or combining it with the data available in NiDB. The later is covered in the tutorial on **Analysis Builder**. The following is an example of creating a report based only on the data imported from Redcap.
