# Reports based on data imported from Redcap

Data that we imported from a Redcap project into a NiDB project can be used to create reports. These reports can be generated based on Redcap data or combining it with the data available in NiDB. The later is covered in the tutorial on [**Analysis Builder**](../analysis-builder.md). The following is an example of creating a report based on the data imported from Redcap.

## Example Report

### Steps

1. From a project's main page click **Analysis Builder**. The above interface is used to produce reports in **Analysis Builder**.
2. Select the variables to generate the report.&#x20;
3. As we are generating report based on the data that is imported from Redcap, the following variables _**cudit1**, **cudit2**_, _**cudit\_3**_... are selected which were mapped as an example in the tutorial [**Importing Data from Redcap Project**](importing-data-from-a-redcap-project.md).
4. There are various setting that can be set to generate a report, more details on this in in the Tutorial on Analysis Builder. After the appropriate setting is selected, Press **Update Summary** button.
5. The report similar to the one shown in the figure below will be displayed.
6. Select the output format as .csv if the data is needed to store in a csv file format.
