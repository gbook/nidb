# Adding Users to Projects

Permissions within NiDB are based on project. This most likely corresponds an IRB approved project, such that certain personnel should have access to the project.

{% hint style="info" %}
To give permissions to other users, you must have NiDB Admin permissions.
{% endhint %}

To add (or remove) a user's permissions to a project:

1. Go to **Admin**-->**Users**
2. Click on the username of the user you want to change
3. If you want to give the user <mark style="color:blue;">**global admin permissions**</mark> within NiDB, check the **NiDB Admin** box at the top of the page. This allows the user to assign permissions to other users, and allows users to delete subjects, studies, and series, for the projects they have permissions for
4. To give permissions to <mark style="color:blue;">**specific projects**</mark>, check the boxes next to the project name.
   1. Project admin allows them to enroll subjects into that project
   2. View/Edit data/PHI are not clearly separated in their functionality. Just select all of these to allow the user access to the project.
5. To remove permissions to specific projects, uncheck the appropriate boxes
6. Click **Update** at the bottom of the page
