# Analysis Builder



## Reports in Analysis Builder

Analysis builder is a report generating tool on the data stored in NiDB. A report can be build based on various types of data, variables, pipelines etc. This is different than the search tool where you can search data and download it. In this tool you can search the variables those are generated and stored / imported in the NiDB (Example: You can query the variables generated from a task using MRI / EEG data). Analysis builder can be invoked from a project's main page by selecting the option (Analysis Builder) on the right from "Tools" section. Following is the main screen of the "Analysis Builder"

### Building Reports

Analysis builder is designed to create reports based on various variables that can be selected from different types of measures, and modalities. These includes modalities like MR, EEG, Biological Measurements etc. as shown in the main screen of Analysis builder above.

#### Steps to generate a simple report

1. To generate a report, select a project from the drop-down menu on the top of the main screen.
2. Select the variables for any one or combination of modalities and measures.
3. Choose if you want to group data on the base of date, or measure&#x20;
4.  The output of a report can be control by various option like:

    * [ ] Selection of all subjects data regardless of their data presence
    * [ ] What should be displayed for a blank value, and missing values
    * [ ] inclusion of, event duration, time, date, subject's height, weight and date of birth


5. Select the report format, showing it on the screen or saving it as csv file.
6. Hit the "Update Summary" button to generate the final report as shown below.
