# Renaming series

Sometimes you need to rename a series. Maybe it was collected in error or was a bad series; you want to keep it, but rename it so the series isn't automatically picked up in pipeline processes or searches.

### Renaming MR series

On the study page, find the series, or series(s), you want to rename. On the rightmost column, check the checkbox(es) for the series. Scroll down to the **With Selected...** menu.

From the menu, select **Rename**

Rename the series(s) and click **Rename**.

The series(s) will now be renamed.

### Renaming non-MR series

Click the protocol name for the series, and an edit box will appear. Edit the protocol (series name) and press &#x65;_&#x6E;ter_.
