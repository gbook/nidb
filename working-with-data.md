## Managing Subjects

### Editing IDs & Demographics
Find your subject by UID or other methods. On the subject's page, you'll see a demographic summary on the left, and the subject's enrollments and studies on the right. On the lefthand side of the page, click the Edit subject button (#2 on the image below). This will show the form to edit demographics. If the edit button is missing, you can check your permissions for the subject by expanding the permissions listing (#1 on the image below).

When editing subject information, required fields are highlighted. Most fields are optional. You can edit IDs on this page, which are reflected for the subject in all projects. The primary alternate ID should have an asterisk in front of it. The primary alternate ID will now be with the main ID for this subject in the specified project. See the ID note below.

> <b>A Note About IDs</b> identifiers are supposed to help you identify a subject. They're supposed to be unique. However, NiDB allows a single subjec to be enrolled in multiple projects. Each project may uniquely identify the subject by the S1234ABC UID which is automatically generated by the system. Or the subject may be identified by an ID generated somewhere else. Maybe the ID is generated by RedCap, or you are given a list of IDs that you need to use for your subjects. If this subject is enrolled in multiple projects, they might have multiple IDs. NiDB is designed to handle this, but it can be a little complicated. Here are some definitions that may help make it simpler

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|UID|Unique ID, assigned by the system. This ID is unique to this installation of NiDB. If this subject is transferred to another NiDB installation, this ID will change|
|Alternate IDs|Comma separated list of IDs that are associated with this subject|
|Primary alternate ID|this alternate ID should be unique within the project. For example, the project uses IDs in the format 2xxx, if this is subject 2382, then their ID should be labeled as \*2382|
|Study Num|The unique number assigned by the system for each of a subject's studies. This number is unique within a subject, regardless of enrollment. For example, if a subject is enrolled in mulitple projects, they may have studies 1,2,3 in project A and studies 5,6 in project B|
|StudyID|This ID basically concatenates the UID and the study num: for example S1234ABC8|
|Alternate StudyID|Sometimes an individual imaging session (study) has it's own unique ID. For example, some imaging centers will give a subject a new ID every time they go into the scanner. This is a place to store that ID|
