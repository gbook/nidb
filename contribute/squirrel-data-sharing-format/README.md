# Squirrel data sharing format

The squirrel data format allows sharing of all information necessary to recreate an experiment and its results, from raw to analyzed data, and experiment parameters to analysis pipelines.

The squirrel format specification is implemented in NiDB. A DICOM-to-squirrel converter, and squirrel validator are available.
